LVDCraft Modpack for Minecraft with Forge!

![bg_minimumsize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72507371/147808290-301428f0-6a85-43b1-a197-1b655347ec30.png)


**SETUP & INSTALLATION**

- **FORGE**: For full compatibility with in-game mods please use Forge 1.16.5 - 36.2.0. The following updates will update to a newer version!

- **PARAMETERS**: I highly recommend 4GB RAM or higher for a best experience. To do that change JVM Arguments to '-Xmx4G'. JVM Arguments will look like this:

```
-Xmx4G -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M
```
- **FILES**: you just need to copy all the files in the modpack and paste it into the folder containing Minecraft (only after installed Forge).

- **OPTIFINE**: I recommend using Optifne G8 for this modpack (https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.16.5_HD_U_G8.jar)


**FEATURES**

 

 

**IDEAS**

This is the first modpack that i made after playing RLCraft (LOL!), of course it will have many problems, i will try to make time to develop it (although i am quite busy).
My original idea was to make something better than vanilla, lots of new mobs, new biomes and more, of course not too hard like RLCraft :), what I want is a higher game experience for players!
