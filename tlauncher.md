**IDEAS**

This is the first modpack that i made after playing RLCraft (LOL!), of course it will have many problems, i will try to make time to develop it (although i am quite busy).
My original idea was to make something better than vanilla, lots of new mobs, new biomes and more, of course not too hard like RLCraft :), what I want is a higher game experience for players!
